        One, two, three and to the four
        Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the door
        Ready to make an entrance so back on up
        'Cause you know we're 'bout to rip shit up
        Give me the microphone first so I can bust like a bubble
        Compton and Long Beach together, now you know you in trouble
        Ain't nuthin' but a G thang, baby
        Two loced out niggas going crazy
        Death Row is the label that pays me
        Unfadeable so please don't try to fade this (Hell yeah)</h3>
